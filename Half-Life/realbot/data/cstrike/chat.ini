# RealBot Chatting Database #
#############################
# Created by Stefan Hendriks
#
#
# This file contains out of several 'sections'. Each section starts with [BLOCK].
# The first line contains "Words=word1,word2,word3,word4" , here are all words
# that a bot can reply on. The more words in a sentence match the words in a block
# the more likely the Chat Engine will choose that block and reply with the given
# sentences in that block. (words in a block are not case sensitive)
#
# Example:
#
# [BLOCK]
# Word=Hi
# Word=Hello
# Word=Heya
# Word=lo
# Sentence=Hey %n
# Sentence=Hi
# Sentence=Hello
# Sentence=Welcome %n
# Sentence=Good to see you %n
#
# When a person says "hi", then the block with "hi" will be choosen and the bot
# who wants to reply to this says either "hey <name>", "hi", Hello, Welcome <name>,
# or Good to see you <name>.
#
# %n is the name of the sender of the message:
# 
# Example:
#
# Jack: Hello all
# Bot: Hey Jack
#
#
# Also notice, the more words match, the more a block is choosen:
#
# [BLOCK]
# Word=like
# Word=cheese
# Sentence=I like cheese too!
#
# [BLOCK]
# Word=like
# Word=hamburger
# Sentence=I like hamburgers too %n
#
# When a player says: I like cheese , the Chat Engine will find 'like' and 'cheese'
# and choose the corresponding block. Replying with "I like cheese too!"
#
# Do mind that this chatting engine is not superbly smart. I.e when you say:
# "Do you like food? like a hamburger?"
# a reply like "I like hamburgers too" is not logical. THerefor keep in mind
# that your replies are as 'general' as possible. Or, be sure your word
# identification (see Tips) is better.
#
# ##############
# TIPS
# ##############
#
# Words can be 'mulitple words'. AS long as you keep below the 20 character limit. 
# Only use %n ONCE in a sentence!
#
#
# DO NOTE: Not all bots will reply, this depends on their ChatRate (personality settings)
#
# ##############
# WELCOME MESSAGES
# ##############
# When bots are just joining the game, they will say "hello" to the rest of the crew
# based upon their chatrate ofcourse. Any sentence they could say, is in this section
#
# ##############
# DEATH MESSAGES
# ##############
# When you want bots to create sentences (not only replying on them) when they are death.
# You can put them in the [DEATH] block. The bots will reply on them using the blocks
# available.
#
# ##############
# LIMITATIONS
# ##############
# Each Block may contain at max 10 words.
# Each Block may contain at max 50 sentences of 80 characters long.
# There may be at maximum 100 blocks.
