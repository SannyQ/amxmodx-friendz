Realbot BUILD 3063:
===================
Need help? Use the forums!



Requirements : Metamod v1.19 must be installed.



What about Linux?
=================
I do not have a Linux box. Use the source to compile it for Linux.
See the realbot\source directory. Be sure you compile it with the most
recent HL SDK and Metamod V1.19.


INSTALLING:
===========
Unzip into : steamapps\<username>\counter-strike

Your directory structure should look like:

steamapps\<username>\counter-strike\
steamapps\<username>\counter-strike\realbot
steamapps\<username>\counter-strike\cstrike
steamapps\<username>\counter-strike\cstrike\addons
etc.

in:
steamapps\<username>\counter-strike\cstrike\addons\metamod\plugins.ini

there should be a line:

win32 ../realbot/dll/realbot_mm.dll

Thats it.


Optional: 
- copy the commandmenu.txt file into your cstrike folder (you can find
commandmenu.txt in the realbot folder). This command menu is modified
to be used with realbot.



Usage:
Start a new game. 
Type:
realbot add

or:
Use command menu, press H (= default button), click on the menu to set things up.


Notice:
=======
Bots need to LEARN maps first. Run around a few rounds, before adding bots in a new map.
The more you play, the more they learn.
